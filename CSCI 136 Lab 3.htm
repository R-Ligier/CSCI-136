    <h3>Due: end of class</h3>
    <h3>TASKS<br>
    </h3>
    For this problem, we wish to draw a number of shapes, using
    "character graphics". For each part of the problem, your program
    should input all parameters from the keyboard (after prompting the
    user). Moreover, the program should ensure that inputs are legal for
    the shape in question. Do not worry about the case where the
    parameters are too big to be displayed properly in the xterm.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Draw a w-wide h-high rectangular frame, using asterisks. Ex
        (w=5, h=4):<br>
        <tt>&nbsp; *****<br>
          &nbsp; * &nbsp; *<br>
          &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>
          &nbsp; *****</tt><br>
      </li>
      <li>Draw the lower triangular part of a square, given the side
        length. Ex (side=5):<br>
        <tt> &nbsp; * <br>
          &nbsp; ** <br>
          &nbsp; ***<br>
          &nbsp; ****<br>
          &nbsp; *****</tt></li>
      <li>Similar to 2, but draw the trapezoid with the bottom <i>height</i>
        elements of the triangle. Ex (side=5, height=3):<br>
        <tt>&nbsp; ***<br>
          &nbsp; ****<br>
          &nbsp; *****</tt></li>
      <li>Similar to 2, but draw the upper triangular part of the square
        (i.e., the other half of the square).</li>
      <li>Given a radius, draw a circle with that radius. <br>
        Hint: Recall that a circle of radius r is defined as the set of
        points (x,y) where x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>&lt;r<sup>2</sup>.
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Although we used character graphics in this lab, the same
      approaches can be used with individual pixels (or squinting hard
      enough at the asterisks). <br>
    </p>

    <h3>HAND IN</h3>
    <p>Your 136 instructor will tell you what to hand in and how.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>GENERAL COMMENTS FOR ALL PROGRAMS THIS SEMESTER </h3>
    <p>You should have the following header on all programs:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>/*<br>
          &nbsp; Author: &lt;name&gt;<br>

    <h3>GRADING</h3>
    <p>All 135 and 136 programs this semester will be graded on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Correctness: Does your program work? <br>
      </li>
      <li>Testing: Have you generated sufficient and good test data to
        give reasonable confidence that your program works?</li>
      <li>Structure: Have you structured your code to follow proper
        software engineering guidelines? This includes readability and
        maintainability.</li>
      <li>Documentation: How well documented is your code? Good
        documentation does not repeat the code in English, but explains
        the point of each code block, highlighting any design decisions
        and/or tricky implementation details. </li>
    </ul>
